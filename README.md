# Retail-Consumer-Behavior-Analysis
This project analyzes a leading retail company's consumer behavior dataset to identify trends, improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing strategies. The analysis explores how factors like demographics, discounts, reviews, and seasons drive purchasing decisions and customer loyalty.

🛠️ Tech Stack

	Data Cleaning & Transformation: Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy).
	
	
	Database Management: PostgreSQL.
	
	
	Exploratory Data Analysis: SQL.


	Data Visualization: Power BI.

📂 Repository Structure

	data/: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets (or scripts to generate them).
	
	
	python_scripts/: Jupyter notebooks or .py files for data preprocessing and SQLAlchemy engine setup.
	
	
	sql_queries/: SQL scripts for table creation, data insertion, and analytical queries (e.g., Top-N analysis, discount rates).
	
	
	powerbi_dashboard/: The .pbix file containing interactive visualizations and insights.
	
	
	reports/: Project report and stakeholder presentation.

💡 Key Business Questions Addressed

	How do discounts impact purchase amounts across different item categories? 
	
	What are the top-selling items per category based on order volume? 
	
	Which demographics (age groups) contribute most to total revenue? 
	
	How does seasonality affect customer shopping patterns? 

🚀 How to Run the Project

	Python: Run the preprocessing script to clean data and load it into your local PostgreSQL instance.
	
	
	SQL: Execute the scripts in sql_queries/ to perform deep-dive analysis.
	
	
	Power BI: Open the .pbix file to explore the interactive dashboard and key performance indicators.
